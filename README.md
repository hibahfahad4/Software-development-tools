#!/bin/bash
This line specifies that the program will be executed by Bash.
# Check if a filename was provided
if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
It checks the number of arguments passed to the script, which should not equal 1.
    echo "Usage: $0 <filename>"
It prints an error message if no filename was provided to the script.
    exit 1
fi
It ends the conditional statement.
# Filename to check
filename="$1"
The filename passed in the script will be assigned as the first argument to the variable "filename."
# Check if the file exists
if [ -e "$filename" ]; then
This conditional statement checks whether the specified file exists using "-e."
   echo "The file exists."
If the file exists, it prints a message that the file exists.
    # Check if the file is readable
    if [ -r "$filename" ]; then
If the file exists, it will check its readability using "-r."
        echo "The file is readable."
If the file is readable, it prints a message that the file is readable.
    else
        echo "The file is not readable."
If the file is not readable, it prints a message that the file is not readable.
    fi
else
    echo "The file does not exist."
If the file does not exist, it prints that the file does not exist.
fi
Then, this script will check whether the file passed to it exists and whether it is readable or not.
